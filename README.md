# About App
This is a completed frontend test task from Aviasales (https://github.com/KosyanMedia/test-tasks/tree/master/aviasales_frontend)

# Extra features
I decided to implement a couple of extra features that weren't in the original task:
+ Button that smoothly scrolls to the top of the page
+ The ability to show more than first 5 tickets

# Libraries used
+ React + Redux
+ Redux-saga - for managing side effects
+ Reselect - for keeping Redux store state minimal and deriving data from the state as needed
+ SASS(SCSS) + CSS modules - for styles
+ ESLint - for cleaner code
